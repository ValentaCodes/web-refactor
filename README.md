# web-refactor

##This project was a refactor for Horiseon, a social solution service. I cleaned up redundant code in CSS and properly structured in HTML. I also added transitions to the nav links to create a more friendly user experience.

##This project took me 4-5 hours to complete and I learned a lot in the process. The biggest issue I faced was trying to break the ".content h2". After an hour of playing with “word-break”. I soon realized it was the "padding" that would help me achieve the result I was looking for.
